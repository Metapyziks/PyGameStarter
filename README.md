## Version Control
You'll use this to download (pull) your code from GitHub, or send changes you make (push)
back to the cloud as a backup and so you can work on your project elsewhere. Pick one:

### SourceTree
More functionality, a bit more complex to set up. You'll need to make sure you select the
option to install git, or else you can install it from Tools -> Options -> Git.

### GitHub Desktop
Less functionality, easier to set up. Integrates nicely with GitHub.

with readability and providing some suggestions while you type.
